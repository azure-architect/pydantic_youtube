## Project Summary: AI Curriculum & LLM-Powered Learning Platform

This document summarizes the conversation regarding the development of an AI curriculum built around YouTube video transcripts, enhanced with metadata to support LLM-based learning, and delivered through a membership platform.

**I. Project Goal:**

To create a membership site offering courses and curriculum based on YouTube videos, empowering users to learn and expand their knowledge using Large Language Models (LLMs). The core value proposition is providing access to videos *plus* meticulously crafted metadata and prompts that enable users to deeply engage with the content and LLMs.

**II. Core Technology Stack:**

*   **Python:** Core programming language.
*   **Pydantic:** Data validation and schema definition.
*   **`ollama` Python Library:** For interacting with locally hosted LLMs (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral). This eliminates costs and rate limits associated with cloud-based LLM APIs.
*   **YouTube Data API:** For retrieving video metadata.

**III. Data Enhancement Procedure:**

The process involves taking each transcript segment and enriching it with metadata designed to facilitate LLM-powered learning.

1.  **Transcript Segmentation:** The YouTube video transcript is already segmented (as provided by the YouTube API).
2.  **Initial Data Extraction:** Extract the text, start time, and duration for each segment.
3.  **LLM-Based Metadata Generation:**  Use the `ollama` library to interact with a local LLM.  For each segment, generate the following metadata:
    *   **Summary:** Concise summary of the segment's content.
    *   **Sentiment:** Overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
    *   **Keywords:** Relevant keywords.
    *   **Entities:** Named entities (people, organizations, concepts).
    *   **Q&A Pairs:** Question-answer pairs based on the segment.
    *   **Prompt Library:** 2-3 high-quality prompts designed to elaborate, apply, or challenge the concepts discussed in the segment.
    *   **Prompt Engineering Notes:** Explanation of *why* the prompts are effective.
    *   **LLM Persona Suggestions:** Recommended LLM personas for optimal results.
    *   **Expected LLM Output Format:**  Indication of the expected output type (e.g., bulleted list, paragraph).
    *   **Common LLM Errors/Hallucinations:** Potential pitfalls to be aware of.
    *   **Related Concepts:** Concepts for prompt chaining.
4.  **Data Validation:**  Ensure the generated metadata conforms to the Pydantic schema.
5.  **Data Storage:** Store the enriched transcript segments in a database or other persistent storage.

**IV. Final Pydantic Schema:**
